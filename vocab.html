  <h2>What is version control?</h2>
  <div>
    <p>Version control is used to keep track of the changes made
      on a set of files over time
      (commonly known as "revisions" or "commits").
      This is useful for recovering from accidentally deleted or broken code
      and for collaborative coding in a team.
      Git is a popular modern version control system that is used
      by many free and open source software projects,
      as well as numerous tech. companies.

  <h2>An overview of the Git repository</h2>
  <div>
    <p>Each Git repository consists of a <code>.git</code> folder
      and the working directory.
      The <code>.git</code> folder contains a representation of
      the version history and
      is usually located inside the working directory.
      The working directory contains the currently "checked-out" commit;
      a staging area (also called the "index") where you collect changes
      in preparation for creating a commit;
      and a tree of commits, each of which represents
      a set of related changes to the project.
    </p>
    <p>Each "change" (or commit) consists of a user-entered message
      describing the changes that were made,
      a representation of the changes themselves,
      and a pointer to the previous commit(s).
      In this way, Git creates a tree of commits that shows
      the evolution of a project over time.

  <h2>How is Git different than other version control systems?</h2>
  <div>
    <p>Git is a distributed version control system,
      which means that every developer's machine contains a complete copy of the repository;
      thus, the entire history of the codebase is always stored locally.
      This is in contrast to many older such sytems that only stored this information on one centralized server.
