<h1>Introduction to Git</h1>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h2>What is version control?</h2>
<div>
	<p>Version control is used to keep track of the changes made
		on a set of files over time
		(commonly known as "revisions" or "commits").
		This is useful for recovering from accidentally deleted or broken code
		and for collaborative coding in a team.
		Git is a popular modern version control system that is used
		by many free and open source software projects,
		as well as numerous tech. companies.
	</p>
</div>

<h2>An overview of the Git repository</h2>
<div>
	<p>Each Git repository consists of a <code>.git</code> folder
		and the working directory.
		The <code>.git</code> folder contains a representation of
		the version history and
		is usually located inside the working directory.
		The working directory contains the currently "checked-out" commit;
		a staging area (also called the "index") where you collect changes
		in preparation for creating a commit;
		and a tree of commits, each of which represents
		a set of related changes to the project.
	</p>
	<p>Each "change" (or commit) consists of a user-entered message
		describing the changes that were made,
		a representation of the changes themselves,
		and a pointer to the previous commit(s).
		In this way, Git creates a tree of commits that shows
		the evolution of a project over time.

<h2>How is Git different than other version control systems?</h2>
<div>
	<p>Git is a distributed version control system,
		which means that every developer's machine contains a complete copy of the repository;
		thus, the entire history of the codebase is always stored locally.
		This is in contrast to many older such sytems that only stored this information on one centralized server.
	</p>
</div>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h2>Regarding code hosting services and public repositories</h2>
<div>
	<p>There are many online services that offer Git repository hosting,
		the most popular being GitHub and BitBucket.
		For the sake of simplicity,
		the CS department recommends that you store your code on department systems.
		If, however, you decide to use a third-party service,
		carefully ensure that your hosted repositories are <i>private</i>!
		If you publish course code to a public repository,
		you can be penalized for cheating pursuant to
		<a href="http://www.rit.edu/academicaffairs/policiesmanual/sectionD/D8.html" target="_blank">RIT's Academic Integrity Policy</a>
		and the <a href="http://www.cs.rit.edu/usr/local/pub/doc/DCS.honesty.final.html" target="_blank">department Policy on Academic Honesty</a>.

<h2>Let's get started!</h2>
<div>
	<p>Now that you have a general idea of what Git is
		and what it can do, let's learn how to use it!
	</p>
	<p><u>Note:</u> it is good practice to keep your files for each
		lab/project/hw assignment in its own distinct subdirectory
		of the appropriate course directory.
		This is wise for both organizational and version control-related reasons,
		as you will see.
