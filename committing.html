<h1>Committing your changes</h1>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<div>
	<p>Recall that the purpose of Git's index is to serve as a place
		to put changes that are ready to be committed.
		This page explores how to manipulate the index and
		turn it into a commit once you're happy with its contents.
	</p>

	</p>
</div>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h2>Querying status</h2>
<!-- This section addresses the status command. -->
<div>
	<p>When using Git, if you are ever unsure of the state of
		your working directory relative to the master branch,
		the <code>status</code> command can be extremely informative.
	</p>
	<p>For example, at this point in the project, nothing has been done.
		Let's do a small experiment to demonstrate the usefulness of the <code>status</code> command!
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>To create a file for our commit (in this case,
			the generic file <code>file1.txt</code>), run:
			<pre>$ touch file1.txt</pre>
		</li>
		<li>To ensure the file was successfully created, run:
			<pre>$ ls</pre>
			You should find <code>file1.txt</code> in the list of files.
		</li>
		<li>Now that we have a file for our first commit,
			let's first check the status of our repo:
			<pre>$ git status</pre> 
		</li>
		<li>This should yield the following output:
	<pre># On branch master
# 
# Initial commit
# 
# Untracked files:
# 	(use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)
# 
# 		file1.txt
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
</pre>
		</li>
		<li>Notice the <code>Untracked files</code> header:
			it indicates that <code>file1.txt</code>'s history is not being tracked in our repository.
			In order for such files to be included in our next commit,
			we will have to learn how to stage/track files.
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h2>Tracking files</h2>
<!--This section discusses adding new files to the index. -->
<div>
	<p>Before we can make any commits,
		we need to tell Git which files we want to include.
		To do this, for each file that we want to be version-controlled,
		we must <code>add</code> it to the holding area for ready-to-commit files
		(aka the "index" or staging area).
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>We want to commit our new file called <code>file1.txt</code>,
			so let's add it to the commit!
			You can do this with the following command:
			<pre>$ git add file1.txt</pre>
		</li>
		<li>To check if it worked, we will use the <code>status</code> tool again:
			<pre>$ git status</pre>
		</li>
		<li>This time, the output generated is different:
	<pre># On branch master
# 
# Initial commit
# 
# Changes to be committed:
# 	(use "git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
# 
# 		new file:	file1.txt
# </pre>
		</li>
		<li>Note that Git now sees our "newly-added" file.
		</li>
		<li>But wait!
			I actually want to change the contents of <code>file1.txt</code>,
			but I already added it to the commit!
			We can fix this issue after we make the desired changes to the file,
			simply by "updating" the version of the file that has already been added to the commit.
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h2>Updating files</h2>
<!-- This section discusses re-adding modified files prior to making a commit -->
<div>
	<p>When working with version-controlled files,
		it is common to suddenly remember something you wanted to do to a file before committing it, but you already added it to the commit!
		Worry not; this is a very easy fix.
	</p>
	<p>We want to make a slight change to <code>file1.txt</code>
		and then make a commit with the most up-to-date version.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Open <code>file1.txt</code> in your favorite text editor,
			and add some text of your choice.
			Save the file and return to the terminal window.
		</li>
		<li>Now what? The <code>status</code> command can give us a hint:
			<pre>$ git status</pre>
		</li>
		<li>Now we see that there are two different versions
			of <code>file1.txt</code> that have not been committed:
			the version in the stage (unchanged) and the one in our current working directory (changed).
	<pre># On branch master
# 
# Initial commit
# 
# Changes to be committed:
# 	(use "git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
# 
# 		new file:	file1.txt
# 
# Changes not staged for commit:
# 	(use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
# 	(use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)
# 
# 		modified:	file1.txt
# </pre>
		</li>
		<li>We must decide whether we want to include these new changes in our next commit:
			<ol type="a">
				<li>If we do want to commit these changes with our earlier ones, we must update the version in the stage to reflect the new ones:
					<ul>
						<li>To re-add the file to the stage:
							<pre>$ git add file1.txt</pre>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>If we only want to commit the first set of changes we made, we should just skip re-adding the file.</li>
				<li>If we no longer want the new changes at all, we can permanently discard them:
					<ul>
						<li>To discard the changes made to <code>file1.txt</code> after it was last added to the stage:
							<pre>$ git checkout -- file1.txt</pre>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>Just to double check that everything is as it should be:
			<pre>$ git status</pre>
		</li>
		<li>Observe the following output:
	<pre># On branch master
# 
# Initial commit
# 
# Changes to be committed:
# 	(use "git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
# 
# 		new file:	file1.txt
# </pre>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h2>Making commits</h2>
<!-- This section discusses making commits -->
<div>
	<ol>
		<li>We have already made sure that the stage accurately represents
			everything that we want to include in our commit,
			so we are ready to go.
		</li>
		<li>To make the commit, use the following command:
			<pre>$ git commit</pre>
		</li>
		<li>If you are working in the terminal, you will automatically
			be taken to your default text editor.
			Enter the commit message "<code>init commit</code>",
			save the file, and exit.
		</li>
		<li>The output produced will look something like this
			(possibly with a few small deviations):
	<pre>[master (root-commit) 949b9f1] init commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 file1.txt</pre>
		</li>
		<li>For the sake of knowledge, let's check our <code>status</code> again,
			now that the commit is complete:
			<pre>$ git status</pre>
		</li>
		<li>Observe the following output:
	<pre># On branch master
nothing to commit (working directory clean) </pre>
		</li>
		<li>Success!
		</li>
		<li><u>Note:</u> Now that we've created a commit,
			we're at a good stopping point to leave the project and come back to it later.
			Just after making a commit is also when we might submit our work for grading once we've finished an assignment.
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h2>Renaming/Moving tracked files</h2>
<!-- This section discusses renaming and moving tracked files. -->
<div>
	<p>Now that we have successfully made a commit, what happens if we need to <b>rename</b> a tracked file?</p>
	<ol>
		<li>To find out, let's rename our <code>file1.txt</code> file
			to the more descriptive name <code>readme.txt</code>:
			<pre>$ git mv file1.txt readme.txt</pre>
		</li>
		<li>Now check the <code>status</code> again:
			<pre>$ git status</pre>
		</li>
		<li>Observe the following output:
	<pre># On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
# 	(use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
#
# 		renamed:	file1.txt -> readme.txt
# </pre>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		If you simply relocate a file within your repository,
		you can use the <code>mv</code> command to update Git in the same way.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>For example, let's move our <code>readme.txt</code> into
			a new directory called <code>documentation</code>:
	<pre>$ mkdir documentation
$ git mv readme.txt documentation/readme.txt</pre>
		</li>
		<li>Now check the <code>status</code> again:
			<pre>$ git status</pre>
		</li>
		<li>Observe the following output:
	<pre># On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
# 	(use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
#
# 		renamed:	file1.txt -> documentation/readme.txt
# </pre>
		</li>
		<li>Note that Git understood that the two changes were referencing
			the same original file, <code>file1.txt</code>.</li>
	</ol>
</div>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h2>Removing tracked files</h2>
<!-- This section discusses removing/deleting tracked files. -->
<div>
	<p>
		It turns out that we do not need our <code>readme.txt</code> file after all.
		We want to delete our working copy, and <i>also</i> tell Git that we deleted it.  To accomplish this, we will use the <code>rm</code> command.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>First things first: we need to delete the <code>readme.txt</code> file:
			<pre>$ rm documentation/readme.txt</pre>
		</li>
		<li>Now check the <code>status</code> to see what happens:
			<pre>$ git status</pre>
		</li>
		<li>Observe the following output:
	<pre># On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
# 	(use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
#
# 		renamed:	file1.txt -> documentation/readme.txt
#
# Changes not staged for commit:
#	(use "git add/rm &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
#	(use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#		deleted:	documentation/readme.txt
# </pre>
		</li>
		<li>To make sure the deletion is included in our next commit,
			follow the directions from the output:
			<pre>$ git rm documentation/readme.txt</pre>
		</li>
		<li>This should result in the following output:
			<pre>rm 'documentation/readme.txt'</pre>
		</li>
		<li>Now check the <code>status</code> again:
			<pre>$ git status</pre>
		</li>
		<li>The output shows that the file has been successfully deleted
			and is no longer being tracked:
	<pre># On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
# 	(use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
#
# 		deleted:	file1.txt
# </pre>
		</li>
		<li>Note that when the file was deleted, any other uncommitted changes
			to that file were also discarded.  (In this example, the fact that we renamed and move the original <code>file1.txt</code> no longer matters.)</li>
	</ol>
</div>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h2>Viewing your commit history</h2>
<!-- This section discusses the use of git log -->
<div>
	<p>If at any point in the progression of your project,
		you want to take a look at a history of all of your commits so far,
		Git has the perfect tool for you!
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>To briefly list all past commits
			(including corresponding commit messages)
			right there in the terminal window:
			<ol>
				<li>Issue the following command and enjoy:
					<pre>$ git log --oneline</pre>
				</li>
				<li>For example, after the above commit,
					a log following this format would be displayed:
					<pre>949b9f1 init commit</pre>
				</li>
				<li>If your log output is longer than the terminal window,
					you will need to press the "q" key to return to the command line.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>If your professor wants proof that you used version control
			(and allows the use of Git),
			you can redirect the verbose commit log into a file to optionally include in the submission of your work for grading.
			<ol>
				<li>For example, to save your commit history in a file
					called <code>log_file.txt</code>, use the following command:
					<pre>$ git log &gt; log_file.txt</pre>
				</li>
				<li>If you open this file in your preferred text editor,
					you'll see that all past commits
					(including corresponding commit messages)
					are now documented.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
			
	</ul>
</div>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h2>Exploring old versions</h2>
<!-- This section addresses checking out trees -->
<div>
	<p>Sometimes it's helpful to experiment
		with an older version of your codebase,
		either for nostalgia or because
		you're trying to determine when you introduced a bug.
		This is where the <code>checkout</code> tool comes in handy.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>First, check your <code>status</code>
			to ensure you do not have any uncommitted changes:
			<pre>$ git status</pre>
			If you do, commit them before continuing.
		</li>
		<li>Examine the output of your most recent <code>log</code>
			(see the previous section for more details)
			and find the hash of the commit you want to work with.
		</li>
		<li>Checkout the version of the code corresponding to the hash value
			<code>&lt;hash&gt;</code>:
			<pre>$ git checkout &lt;hash&gt;</pre>
		</li>
		<li>Read, build, and experiment with this older version of your code,
			but <i>DO NOT</i> make changes you want to keep
			or attempt to commit anything.
		</li>
		<li>Once you're ready to return to the latest version of your code,
			execute this command:
			<pre>$ git checkout master</pre>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h2>Viewing diffs</h2>
<!-- This section discusses all sorts of useful diff commands -->
<div>
	<p>If you ever reach a point where you would like to see the differences 
		between two different states of your repository,
		the <code>diff</code> tool can be quite useful.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>To view the differences between your working directory
			and the <code>HEAD</code>, run the following:
	        <pre>$ git diff /path/to/filename</pre>
	    </li>
		<li>To view the differences between the changes you have staged
			and some arbitrary commit, run the following:
	        <pre>$ git diff --cached &lt;commit&gt; /path/to/filename</pre>
	        Note:  In this situation, the &lt;commit&gt; argument is optional.
	        If you do not include it, the command will use the currently&ndash;checked out
			commit as the basis for comparison, by default.
	    </li>
	    <li>To view the differences between your working directory
	    	and some arbitrary commit, run the following:
	        <pre>$ git diff &lt;commit&gt; /path/to/filename</pre>
	    </li>
	    <li>To view the differences between two arbitrary commits, run the following
	        <pre>$ git diff &lt;commit1&gt; &lt;commit2&gt; /path/to/filename</pre>
	    </li>
	</ul>
</div>
